cssls!(AtA,AtB,X,P)

Solve combinatorial subspace least squares (CSSLS) problem. Find X[P] that
minimizes ||A*X[P] - B[P]|| in the least squares sense, where P is a
1-bit matrix encoding the combinatorial subspace. Input X is overwritten
with the solution.

In the context of nonnegative least squares, each column of X has a passive
set which is encoded by "true" entries in P, and an active set which is encoded
by "false" entries in P.

Inputs:
	AtA = A' * A = (n x n) matrix
	AtB = A' * B = (n x k)
	P = 1-bit matrix of Bools = (? x ?) matrix
